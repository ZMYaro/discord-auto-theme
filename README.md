# Auto Theme for Discord

Previously, you could only set Discord to have a dark or light theme, but not to have it match your operating system dark/light theme.  This extension would match your Discord theme to your system theme.

**This extension is now obsolete due to Discord adding the “Sync with computer” option under Appearance settings.**
